Exploratory Data Analysis – EDA

EDA is applied to investigate the data and summarize the key insights.

It will give you the basic understanding of your data, it’s distribution, null values and much more.

You can either explore data using graphs or through some python functions.

There will be two type of analysis. Univariate and Bivariate.
In the univariate, you will be analyzing a single attribute.
But in the bivariate, you will be analyzing an attribute with the target attribute.

In the non-graphical approach, you will be using functions such as shape, summary, describe, isnull, info, datatypes and more.

In the graphical approach, you will be using plots such as scatter, box, bar, density and correlation plots.

In this folder, there are projects which shows how an EDA is done and what insights do we get to derive from data during this awesome process
